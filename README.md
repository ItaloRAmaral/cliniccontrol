## About The Project

<!-- ![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png) -->

In the fast-paced and demanding field of psychology, professionals need an effective way to manage their practices without getting bogged down by administrative tasks. Our project aims to simplify and streamline these processes so that psychologists can focus more on what really matters: their patients.

##### Features (_under developtment!_)

- <b>⏳- Schedule Management:</b> Easily schedule appointments, set reminders, and automate cancellations to manage your time efficiently.
- <b>⏳- Cost Tracking:</b> Accurately record and analyze costs such as rent, utilities, and supplies, to get a clear picture of your overhead expenses.
- <b>⏳- Earnings Monitoring:</b> Keep track of payments, generate invoices, and visualize your income over various time frames to understand your financial health.
- <b>⏳- Client Management:</b> Safely store client information, treatment plans, and session notes in one centralized, secure database.
- <b>⏳- Data Visualization:</b> Use intuitive graphs and charts to understand your practice's performance metrics, like client retention, earnings, and more.
- <b>⏳- User-Friendly Interface:</b> Designed with user experience in mind, making it easy for anyone to use, even with little to no technical expertise.

## Built With

This project leverages a robust and modern tech stack to deliver a fast, secure, and scalable solution. Below are some of the key technologies, frameworks, and architectures we've used:

##### Architecture

- <b>Hexagonal Architecture:</b> This architecture separates the core logic of the application from the services that it uses, making the system more maintainable, scalable, and testable.

##### Monorepo Management

- [Nx Workspace:](https://nx.dev) Utilized for efficient monorepo management, Nx Workspace allows for optimized builds, code sharing, and powerful development tools.

##### Frontend

- [Vite:](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) A build tool and development server that serves as the backbone for our frontend, offering fast development and build times.
- [ReactJS:](https://react.dev) Employed for building a dynamic and interactive UI, React allows for efficient data rendering and state management.

##### Backend

- [NestJS:](https://nestjs.com) A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
